    <div class="pagetext">Kyros is a multimedia storytelling platform centered around capturing and sharing group experiences. 
    Inspired by the Greek word χρόνος, meaning an opportune moment, Kyros allows experience-seekers to collaboratively create storylines - bullet journals that capture experiences in a multifaceted digital timeline - with their friends/family and share them with inner circles and/or the world. The platform also allows people to use AR to explore their surroundings and discover the best crowd-sourced recommendations sourced from other Kyros users.

        Our platform centers around three pillars: explore, saved and experiences. <br>
        Explore: users can explore the storylines created by their friends/family or public content creators on the platform, allowing them to experience their friends/family's moments, as well as get inspiration for their own plans through public content creators. Explore also crowd-sources the best recommendations for users during their travels. <br><br>
        Saved: users can view a map of storylines sorted by location, to visualize their travel/experience wishlist/itinerary.<br><br>
        Experiences: users can collaboratively create their own storylines, document their shared experiences, toggle between shareability (close friends, friends, public), and plan how to share these moments with their friends, family and the world.<br><br>
